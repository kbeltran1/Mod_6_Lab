# Mod_6_Lab
These six problems added in expanding my knowlege of using the random and math modules. I was able to created programs where random numbers are printed and I added specifc requirements, one example being making sure each random number selected is odd. I used the math modules to be able to create conversions from degrees to radians, or solving for the factorials of a number entered.
